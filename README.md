## A Convolutional Neural Network to detect cracks on a surface

### Description:

Concrete is one of the most used and important materials in civil construction. Our houses, our offices, the bridges that connect cities and a lot of other types of constructions, are made of concrete, or if concrete is not the main material, at least is used in some part of the construction. The major defect detected in civil structures are the surface cracks on concrete. It is important to make inspections in the structure to evaluate the rigidity and the tensile, once these concrete surface cracks can compromise the structure and cause big problems and disasters. Then it is very important to make inspections regularly in the structures in order to detect these cracks in the early stage to avoid major problems in the future. A convolutional neural network could be used to do a classification and an analysis if there is a surface crack in the photos taken during the process of structure inspection.
